It is used as a placeholder in magazine layouts, for example, in order to give an impression of the finished document. The text is intentionally unintelligible so that the viewer is not distracted by the content. The language is not real Latin and even the first word Lorem’ does not exist.

However, because our range includes magazines from countries such as Australia, the USA and the United Kingdom, sending them back would involve considerable effort in terms of logistics and would also be very expensive. We therefore choose not to return any unsold magazines. At the same time, this allows us to also offer our customers older or out-of-print magazines.",
